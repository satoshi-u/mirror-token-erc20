# mirror-token-erc20

This is a truffle project.

Clone the repo to your local.

I use Gaanche as my local blockchain. Please install it if you don't have it already. You can edit the config in truffle.config.js to connect to any other network as well.

Run "truffle compile" to compile the contracts and get the artifacts & abis.

Run "truffle test" to run the tests and see the functionalities working.
